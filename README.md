###The Experience / Learning Outcomes
Angular2 was quite difficult for me to make sense of when it was first introduced in class. However, as we started doing the project, I was able to wrap my head more about what it can do. Beyond that, it also helped me practice reading  directories of files and (new) lines of code.

I would definitely keep on learning about Angular2 so I can explore more on what else I can do with it.
